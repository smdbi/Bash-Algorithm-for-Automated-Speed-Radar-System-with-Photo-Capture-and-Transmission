#Bash Algorithm for Automated Speed Radar System with Photo Capture and Transmission

Description:
This algorithm seamlessly integrates with the radar setup to execute instantaneous speed checks and triggers a flash when a vehicle surpasses 110 km/h on the highway. Simultaneously, a photograph of the vehicle's license plate is captured, ready to be dispatched to the police headquarters.



Algorithm Insights:
Automated Speed Control: Explore the intricacies of an automated speed radar system that efficiently detects vehicles exceeding the speed limit and initiates real-time actions.
Flash and Capture Mechanism: Gain insights into the process of activating a flash when a speeding vehicle is detected, capturing a high-resolution image of the license plate.
Centralized Dispatch: Experience the journey of securely transferring the license plate photograph to the police headquarters using the versatile 'curl' utility.




Script Annotations:
      #Scrot (SCreenshOT) is an open-source utility used to capture and save images, specific windows, and more.
      #We invoke a flashing function that requires specialized libraries and hardware, which are not explicitly outlined in this context.
      #Curl is employed in scripts for data transfer. In our context, it facilitates the seamless transmission of the captured photograph to the police headquarters.
